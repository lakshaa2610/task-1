## Internship Experience at CodSoft

During my internship at CodSoft, I worked on a series of challenging machine learning and data science projects. This experience allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, develop strong analytical skills, and gain proficiency in Python and its data science ecosystem. Below are detailed summaries of the five main tasks I completed:

---

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

**Objective:**  
Predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, and fare.

**Process & Tools:**  
- Collected and explored the Titanic dataset to understand variable distributions and relationships.
- Performed extensive data cleaning, handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover survival patterns.
- Engineered new features (e.g., family size, title extraction from names) to improve model performance.
- Built and evaluated multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
- Used techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Assessed model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

**Outcome:**  
Achieved a robust predictive model and gained insights into the most influential factors affecting passenger survival.

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction

**Objective:**  
Develop a regression model to predict movie ratings based on various attributes such as genre, director, cast, budget, and release year.

**Process & Tools:**  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the movie dataset, including dealing with missing data and encoding categorical variables.
- Performed EDA to identify key factors influencing movie ratings and visualized trends.
- Applied feature engineering, such as extracting information from textual data and normalizing features.
- Built regression models using Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
- Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score.
- Tuned model hyperparameters to further improve prediction accuracy.

**Outcome:**  
Learned effective ways to handle multivariate regression tasks and identified major factors affecting movie ratings.

### 3. Iris Flower Classification

**Objective:**  
Classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

**Process & Tools:**  
- Utilized the classic Iris dataset for this multiclass classification task.
- Conducted EDA to visualize the distribution of features and class separability.
- Applied data preprocessing, such as scaling features.
- Implemented various classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree.
- Visualized decision boundaries and confusion matrices to interpret model performance.
- Optimized models through cross-validation and parameter tuning.

**Outcome:**  
Developed high-accuracy models and strengthened my understanding of supervised learning and classification evaluation.

### 4. Sales Prediction Using Python

**Objective:**  
Forecast future sales for a retail dataset to support business planning.

**Process & Tools:**  
- Cleaned and preprocessed historical sales data, handling missing values and outliers.
- Explored sales trends, seasonality, and patterns using time series analysis and visualizations.
- Engineered new features (e.g., lag variables, rolling averages) to capture temporal dependencies.
- Built predictive models using techniques such as Linear Regression, ARIMA, and Random Forest Regressor.
- Evaluated model forecasts with MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics.
- Delivered actionable insights and visualizations to support business decision-making.

**Outcome:**  
Demonstrated the ability to work with time series data and generate accurate sales forecasts for practical use.

### 5. Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective:**  
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions to enhance financial security.

**Process & Tools:**  
- Worked with a highly imbalanced dataset containing real-world transaction data.
- Performed extensive EDA to understand fraud patterns and data distribution.
- Addressed class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
- Preprocessed data: scaling, outlier detection, and feature selection.
- Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Focused on metrics suitable for imbalanced data: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
- Analyzed feature importance to identify key indicators of fraud.

**Outcome:**  
Developed an effective fraud detection model and gained experience in handling real-world data challenges such as class imbalance.
